# Notebot

A notemaker made in Python

## What the hell is its purpose?

Not even I know! I guess it's the digital version of notes people used to give each other back in the day, but it's on a computer and it can't be emailed. Unless of course you copy the contents of the terminal screen.

### Requirements:

- A computer
- Python 3.6 or higher
- A terminal emulator to run Python through (I.E, on Windows, Command Prompt)
